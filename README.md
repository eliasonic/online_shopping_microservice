# Grocery_Online_Shopping_App
Online Grocery Shopping Application using Microservice architecture. The application uses API gateway for request routing and http calls (webhooks) for communication between the services. This is later replaced with nginx as reverse proxy and rabbitmq message broker for microservice communication for production. This implementation can be seen here [Online Shopping App Microservice Architecture with RabbitMQ](https://github.com/eliasonic/online_shopping_microservice_rabbitmq).
